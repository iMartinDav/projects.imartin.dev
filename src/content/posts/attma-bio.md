# Introduction

**Attma** is an opinionated, AI‑native bioinformatics assistant built on a modern **Next.js** front end and **FastAPI** orchestration layer. It takes the grind out of turning raw DNA/RNA reads, protein interaction data, and a wall of papers into something a scientist can act on before the meeting ends.

In one place you can:
- Prioritize variants (rare disease, oncology panels, emerging viral lineages) without juggling half a dozen scripts.
- Ask plain English questions and get reproducible multi‑omics comparisons – *“Show differentially expressed immune escape markers between cohort A and B.”*
- Surface non‑obvious patterns across sequence features, expression shifts, structural motifs for early drug target triage.
- Mine and condense fresh literature into gene–drug and pathway–phenotype relationship summaries.
- Generate clean, publication‑ready visuals and concise regulatory style summaries.

Built for real searches: **genomic variant analysis**, **automated variant interpretation**, **rare disease genomics**, **drug discovery acceleration**, **bioinformatics LLM assistant**, **multi‑omics integration**, **protein structure analysis**, **viral mutation tracking**, **literature mining platform**. All of that without the usual copy‑paste fatigue.

> Weeks of manual bioinformatics workflow → minutes of guided, auditable analysis.
